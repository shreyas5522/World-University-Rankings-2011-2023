# Data Story

The code utilizes the pandas and numpy libraries to analyze university rankings data. It is likely that the data being analyzed is a large dataset of universities from around the world, with various ranking metrics such as overall rank, research impact, and teaching quality. The goal of the analysis could be to identify patterns and trends within the data, such as which countries or regions have the highest concentration of highly-ranked universities, or which universities have consistently improved or declined in rank over time.

Given the use of pandas and numpy, it's possible that the data needs to be cleaned and processed before analysis. Data cleaning could involve handling missing or invalid data, normalizing the data, and filtering out any outliers or irrelevant data points. Once the data has been cleaned and processed, it can be aggregated and sorted according to various metrics to gain insights into the overall trends within the data.

Overall, it appears that the code is part of a larger data analysis project aimed at gaining insights into the performance and ranking of universities across the world. These insights could be useful for a variety of stakeholders, including university administrators, policymakers, and students who are interested in understanding the higher education landscape across the world.

# Thought Process

Finding the top-ranking universities may vary depending on the stakeholder or the purpose of the analysis. For university administrators, identifying the top-ranking universities can provide insight into the factors that contribute to success, such as research funding, teaching quality, and student satisfaction. This information can be used to improve the performance of their own universities and attract more students and faculty.

# Algorithm Used

The code makes use of the following libraries:

- pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: for numerical computations.

The code does not explicitly use any algorithm, but it performs data cleaning, aggregation, and sorting operations on the university rankings data.
