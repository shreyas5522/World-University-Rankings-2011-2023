#Data Story
##Over the past 13 years, how has the number of universities ranked by the organization changed and which countries have consistently been in the top rankings?

#Thought Process
##The script provides data on university rankings from 2011 to 2023. To begin the analysis, we will first look at the total number of universities ranked per year to see if there has been any significant change. Next, we will focus on the top countries with the highest number of universities ranked each year to see if there have been any changes in the rankings over time.

#Algorithms/Libraries
##The script uses the pandas library for data manipulation and the matplotlib library for visualization. For the visualization, the script generates a pie chart using the plt.pie() function from matplotlib. It also generates a text table using string formatting to print the top 10 countries and their percentage of universities ranked.
