# Developing a data story:
To develop a data story, it's important to identify the key questions or insights that the data can provide. For example, with a university ranking dataset, one might be interested in the following questions:
What are the top universities overall?
What are the top universities for computer science?
How have university rankings changed over time?
What factors contribute to university rankings?
Are there any regional trends in university rankings?
Based on these questions, you can develop a narrative that presents the insights and answers to these questions. For example, you could start by presenting an overview of the top universities overall, then dive into the top universities for computer science and how they compare to the overall rankings. You could then show how rankings have changed over time, potentially using visualizations to show trends or patterns. Finally, you could explore the factors that contribute to university rankings, such as research output or student-to-faculty ratios.

# Thought process
The best computer science university across the globe, including:
Career prospects: Computer Science is one of the most in-demand and lucrative fields today, with a vast array of job opportunities available across the globe. Choosing a top-ranked university in the field can give an individual an edge in the job market and help them secure better career prospects.
Quality of education: Pursuing a degree in computer science from a reputed university ensures a quality education and access to the latest technologies, resources, and research facilities. This can help individuals develop their skills and knowledge in the field and stay ahead of the curve.
Networking opportunities: Attending a top-ranked university can provide individuals with access to a network of influential and successful alumni, professors, and industry leaders. This network can be invaluable in securing internships, job opportunities, and partnerships in the future.

# Algorithms/libraries for visualization:
There are many algorithms and libraries that can be used for data visualization, depending on the specific needs and goals of the data story. Some popular libraries for visualization in Python include:
Matplotlib: a versatile library for creating static visualizations of many types, from line charts to scatter plots to bar graphs.
Seaborn: a library that builds on top of Matplotlib and offers additional types of plots and more sophisticated color palettes.
Plotly: a library for creating interactive visualizations, such as heatmaps or 3D scatter plots.
Bokeh: another library for interactive visualization, with a focus on creating web-based dashboards and applications.
